```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
library(mosaic)   # Load additional packages here 
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Some customization.  You can alter or delete as desired (if you know what you are doing).
trellis.par.set(theme=theme.mosaic()) # change default color scheme for lattice
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
```


## The data

```{r head-data}

atheism <- read_csv(here::here("data", "atheism.csv"))
```

What does each row of Table 6 correspond to? What does each row of 
    `atheism` correspond to?
*Each row of Table 6 corresponds to a country and how it is segmented based on religious preferences and each row of atheism dataset corresponds to the response and the year it was made.*

Calculate the proportion of atheist responses. Does it agree with the percentage in Table 6? If not, why?

```{r us-atheism, eval=FALSE}
us_atheism <- atheism %>%
  filter(nationality == "United States") %>% 
  select(response,year)

tally(~response|year, margins=TRUE, data=us_atheism)

#CI for 2005
prop.test(10,1002) %>% 
  confint()
```
*Yes, they correspond to the ones in table 6 as a convinced atheist is 5%, however the rest of the categories (a religious person, not a religious person, and don't know) are clumped together in the atheist dataset to make up the 95%.*

## Inference on proportions

# Calculating standard error and constructing the interval 


```{r us-atheism-ci, tidy = FALSE}
prop.test(50,1002) %>% confint()
```

Based on the R output, what is the margin of error for the estimate of the 
    proportion of the proportion of atheists in US in 2012?
    
*The margin of error is 3.76- 6.57% at 95% confidence.*

Calculate confidence intervals for the proportion of atheists in 2012 in India and Finland.
    
```{r}
india_atheism <- atheism %>%
  filter(nationality == "India") %>% 
  select(response,year)

tally(~response|year, margins=TRUE, data=india_atheism)

prop.test(33,1092) %>% 
  confint()

finland_atheism <- atheism %>%
  filter(nationality == "Finland") %>% 
  select(response,year)

tally(~response|year, margins=TRUE, data=finland_atheism)

prop.test(55,985) %>% 
  confint()
```
*The margin of error in India is 2.12-4.27% at 95% confidence and  in Finland, it is between 4.27-7.25% at 95% confidence interval.*

## How does the proportion affect the margin of error?

```{r me-plot, eval=FALSE}
n <- 1000

errors <- tibble(
  p = seq(0, 1, 0.01),
  me = 2 * sqrt(p * (1 - p)/n)  
)



ggplot(errors, aes(x=p, y = me))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(y = "Margin of Error", x = "Population Proportion") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Describe the relationship between `p` and `me`.

*As population proportion increases, margin of error increases and once then the margin of error decreases after population proportion is at 50%.*

## Success-failure condition

```{r sim-np, eval=FALSE}
p <- 0.1
n <- 1040
p_hats <- rep(0, 5000)

for(i in 1:5000){
  samp <- sample(c("atheist", "non_atheist"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(p, 1-p))
  p_hats[i] <- sum(samp == "atheist")/n
}

p_hats
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

gf_histogram(~p_hats, binwidth = 0.005, fill="skyblue") %>%
  gf_labs(title = "p = 0.1, n = 1040")%>%
  gf_theme(theme=theme_minimal())
  


```
    **a.** Is there convincing evidence that Spain has seen a change in its atheism index between 2005 and 2012?
    
```{r}
    spain_atheism <- atheism %>%
  filter(nationality == "Spain") %>% 
  select(response,year)

tally(~response|year, margins=TRUE, data=spain_atheism)

#CI for 2005
prop.test(115,1146) %>% 
  confint() 

#CI for 2012
prop.test(103,1145) %>% 
  confint()


```
   *CI in 2012 for Spain is between 7.43% and 10.84% and in 2005 is between 8.38% and 11.96%. The confidence intervals in the two years overlaps, and there isn't sufficient evidence to state that the atheism index has changed by much. One can infer with 95% confidence that aethism has reduced since 2005.*
   
 Is there convincing evidence that the United States has seen a change in its atheism index between 2005 and 2012?
    
   *CI for 2012 for US is between 3.76% and 6.57% and in 2005 is between 0.50 to 1.89%. We can say with 95% confidence that aethism has increased in the US since 2005 by about 3.86% to 4.68%. This seems to match up with the results in Table 4.*

# How about a country with no change in Atheism Index?
    
    ```{r}
      austria_atheism <- atheism %>%
  filter(nationality == "Austria") %>% 
  select(response,year)

tally(~response|year, margins=TRUE, data=austria_atheism)

#CI for 2005
prop.test(100,1003) %>% 
  confint() 

#CI for 2012
prop.test(100,1002) %>% 
  confint()
    ```
