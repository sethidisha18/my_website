# Exercise in Tidying data
```{r}

library(tidyr)
#viewing tables
table1
table2
table3
table4a
table4b

# Compute rate per 10,000
modtable1<-table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)

# Compute cases per year
table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)

# Visualise changes in TB cases over time from 1999 to 2000
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))

```
**how are the variables and observations organised in each of the sample tables?**
*Table 1 shows the cases in 3 countries in 1999 and 2000 and their population. Table 2 lists the number of cases and population in one column and segments them by type. This is not the most effective way of reading the cases. Table 3 shows the rate of cases in 1999 and 2000 by dividing the number of cases by population, however this rate is not shown in numerical values. Table 4a shows data spread in columns by years showing the number of cases and Table 4b shows the population in those 2 years for the three countries. These two tables are much more efficient in displaying the data.*

  #to compute rate
  pivot_wider(names_from="type",
              values_from="count")%>%
  mutate(rate=(cases/population)*10000) %>%
#to store back in appropriate place
  pivot_longer(3:5,
               names_to="type",
               values_to="count")

           "cases2000"= `2000.x`,
           "pop1999"=`1999.y`,
           "pop2000"=`2000.y`)%>%
  
  #calculating rate of cases in 1999 and 2000
mutate(rate1999=(cases1999/pop1999)*10000,
        rate2000=(cases2000/pop2000)*10000)%>%
  
  #lengthening the table 
  pivot_longer(2:7,
               names_to="type",
              values_to="count")%>%
  
  #visualising changes in cases
  #only need case numbers
  filter(type==c("cases1999","cases2000"))%>%
  ggplot(aes(type,count))+ 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))+
  #changing names of values in x-axis
   scale_x_discrete(labels = c('1999','2000'))+
  #changing axis titles
  labs(x="year",y ="cases")+
  NULL
```
**Which table is easier to work with?**
*Table 2 is easier to work with as all the information about cases and population is in the same table. Even though Table4a and Table 4b are easier to read separately, to create a graph of change in cases and calculate rate of cases, more lines of code are required*

#A study in pivot longer vs. pivot wider
```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half  = c(   1,    2,     1,    2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
)

stocks %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return) %>% 
  pivot_longer(`2015`:`2016`, names_to = "year", values_to = "return")

```
*Pivot longer and pivot wider are not perfectly symmetrical because of the column `half`*

```{r}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)

pivot_wider(preg,
            names_from="pregnant",
            values_from=c("male","female"))

pivot_longer(preg,
             2:3,
             names_to="gender",
             values_to="number")
```

```{r}
cleaned_who<-who %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, 
    names_to = "key", 
    values_to = "cases", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")
  ) %>%
  separate(key, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)

```
**Is using `values_drop_na` reasonable?**
*Yes, it is because without it there are 329394 rows that are there with NA values. There is a difference between NA and 0. 0 indicates that there were 0 cases reported, whereas NA indicates not applicable as there is no data available for that specific value.*

**What if we skip `mutate` step?**
*Skipping the mutate step, causes NA values to appear for sex and age as `_` separator is not there. Even though all rows appear and no error is shown, the data becomes distorted for some rows.*

**Why are `iso2` and `iso3` redundant?**
*Because they do not add anything to the dataset. We already have the country name and these are just country codes.*
