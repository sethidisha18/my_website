*At the end of this challenge, we will produce this chart that uses the FRED database to downlaod historical yield curve rates and plot the yield curves since 1999.*

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

This dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}
#Join this datframe 'df' with dataframe 'mylookup' to have a more readable version
yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol")

### Yield curve inversion

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? 

*Yes, it seems that between those two dates the yield curve flattens before inverting.*

Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? 
*According to the following graph, it seems that where the yield curve flattens, a reccession followed. Though it cannot be taken as the only factor, it should be taken as a warning signal.*

Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?

*The following graphs shows 9 occassions on when this happened, as we calculate the spread (10-year-3months) and label it 'diff'*
